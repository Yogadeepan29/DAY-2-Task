# Difference between document and window object ?

 In JavaScript, both window and document are fundamental objects, but they serve different purposes in web development:

 >> Window Object (window):

     > The window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the HTML document.
     > It is the top-level JavaScript object in a browser's object model and serves as a global scope for all JavaScript code running within that window.
     > It provides properties and methods for manipulating the browser window itself, such as resizing, moving, opening new windows, etc.
     > Additionally, it contains references to other important objects like document, history, location, and more.

     Syntax:
        window.propertyName

 >> Document Object (document):

     > The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
     > It is a child object of the window object and is accessible through window.document or simply document.
     > It provides properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the content of the HTML document, such as selecting elements, modifying their attributes and content, handling events, etc.
     > Essentially, it allows JavaScript to interact with and modify the structure and content of the web page currently loaded in the browser.

     Syntax:
        document.propertyName

 >> Conclusion:

     the JavaScript window and document are two of the most important objects in JavaScript, and both have different purposes.
     The window represents the current web browser window, whereas the document object represents the web page that is currently loaded in the window.
     While both objects are global and can be accessed from anywhere in our code.
